difference between window,screen and document?

JAVASCRIPT WINDOW:
The window is at a root/top level at the JavaScript object hierarchy.
It  is a global/root object in JavaScript and it is the root object of the Document object model(DOM);

JAVASCRIPT DOCUMENT:
A document is an object inside the window object and we use a document object for manipulation inside the document.
The first thing that gets loaded into the browser is the window and the properties related to that window are stored in the window object.
Properties related to window objects are length, innerWidth, innerHeight, caches, etc.
